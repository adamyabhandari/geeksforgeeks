Arithmetic Operators

You are given two integer variables x and y. You need to perform the following operations:

p = x+y : Addition
q = x-y : Subtraction
r = x*y :Multiplication
s = x/y : Float Division with a precision of 5 decimal places
t = x//y : Int Division
u = x%y : Modulo
v = x**y : Power

Example 1:

Input:
x = 1
y = 2
Output: 
3 -1 2 0.50000 0 1 1 
Explanation: The given operations are performed.
Example 2:

Input:
x = 3 
y = 4 
Output: 
7 -1 12 0.75000 0 3 81
Explanation: The given operations are performed

Your Task: 
Just complete the mentioned code snippets. The input and output are already done by the given code.

SOLUTION
def utility():
    #The below code takes input of x and y. Don't change it!
    x=int(input())
    y=int(input())
    
    # Perform addition x+y below
    p = x+y
    # Perform subtraction x-y below
    q = x-y
    # Perform multiplication x*y below
    r = x*y
    # Perform float division x/y below
    s = x/y
    # Perform integer divison x//y below
    t = x//y
    # Perform modulo operation x%y below
    u = x%y
    # Perform power(x,y) x**y belx/yow
    v = x**y
    
    #The below code prints the output. Don't change it!
    print(p,q,r,"{:.5f}".format(s),t,u,v)
