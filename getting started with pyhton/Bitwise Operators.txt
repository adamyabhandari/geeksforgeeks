Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are useful when we want to work with bits. Here, we'll take a look at them.

Given three positive integers a, b, and c. Your task is to perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
1. d = a ^ a
2. e = c ^ b
3. f = a & b
4. g = c | (a ^ a)
5. h = ~e
Note: ^ is for xor. The working of bitwise operators can be found here. You have to print all the 5 values in different lines according to order given.

Example:

Input:
a = 4
b = 8
c = 2
Output:
0
10
0
2
-11
Constraints:
1 <= A, B, C <= 106

SOLUTIONS-> The provided code is in JAva
class Geeks {
    // Function to perform bitwise manipulations
    // a, b and c are input integers
    static void bitWiseOperation(int a, int b, int c) {

        // code here
        int e=c^b;
        System.out.println(a^a);
         System.out.println(c^b);
         System.out.println(a&b);
          System.out.println(c|(a^a));
         System.out.println(~e);
    }
