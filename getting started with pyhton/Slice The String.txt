Slice The String


Given a string s, you need to slice it so that the output is a substring that contains all the chracters except first and last. The length of the s will be greater than 2.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "Hello"
Output: 
ell
Explanation: The first and last character
are ignored.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "World"
Output:
orl
Explanation: The first and last characters
are ignored.
Your Task: 
The input s is provided as a parameter to the function sliceString. You need to return the sliced string. The driver code will print the output.

SOLUTION
def sliceString(s):
    #Write your code below
    return (s[1:len(s)-1])
