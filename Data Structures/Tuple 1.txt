Your Task: 
Write the code to create a tuple containing double the given tuple. Finally, return the tuple. The driver code will print the returned tuple.

SOLUTION
def doubleTup(numbers):
    
    #Write your code to create a tuple that 
    #holds 2*number 
    #Finally retrn the tuple
    tpl=tuple(2*i for i in numbers)
    return tpl
