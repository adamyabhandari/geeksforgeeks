Swap The Numbers


Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a. Just write the code to swap values of a and b at the specified place. The input and output are done automatically.

Examples

Input: a = 1 b = 2
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2, now a = 2 and b = 1.
Input: a = 6 b = 7  
Output: 7 6 
Explanation: Initially a = 6 and b = 7, now a = 7 and b = 6.

SOLUTION
class Solution:
    def utility(self, a, b):
        #code here
        c=a
        a=b
        b=c
        print(a,b);
