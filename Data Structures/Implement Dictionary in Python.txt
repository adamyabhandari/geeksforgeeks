Implement Dictionary in Python


You are familiar with most of the properties of dictionaries in Python. Add some more info about the dictionary through dictionary formatting and deleting key-value pairs.

Let's get this into head by solving a question. Given some queries for dictionary.

The task is to do some operations as described below:

a. i key value: Driver code calls the function insert_dict() which inserts key and value in the dictionary, and prints 'Inserted'.
b. d key: Driver code calls the function del_dict() which deletes the entry for a given key and prints 'Deleted' if the key to be deleted is present, else prints '-1'.
c. key: print marks of given key in statement as "Marks of {student_name} is : {marks}". If key is not present print '-1'.

Example:

Input:
5
i geeks 100
i for 200
d geeks
i geeks 300
p geeks

Output:
Inserted
Inserted
Deleted
Inserted
Marks of geeks is 300

Explanation:
For first four queries, insert and del operation happens, correspondingly Inserted and Deleted is printed. 
For last query, marks of geeks is printed.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= | key | <= 20
1 <= marks <= 105

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function insert_dict(), del_dict() and print_dict() which should do the operations as required.

SOLUTION
# insert into dictionary and print "Inserted"
def insert_dict(key, value, Dict):
    #code here
    Dict[key]=value
    print("Inserted")
    

# deleting from dictionary and print "Deleted" if key present else "-1"
def del_dict(key, Dict):
    #code here
    if key in Dict:
        del Dict[key]
        print("Deleted")
    else:
        print(-1)
    
    

# print marks of student whos name is key if student name is present in Dict else "-1"
def print_dict(key, dict):
    
    # Your code here
    if key in dict:
        print("Marks of",key, "is",dict[key])
    else:
        print(-1)
