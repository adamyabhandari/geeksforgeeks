Function With Arguments


Here two integers a and b are given. The take input and their values are passed as arguments to the function argumentFunction. The argumentFunction is responsible for the syntax print(a+b). You need to write this function.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 2
b = 3
Output: 
5
Explanation: 2+3=5.
Your Task: 
You have to declare and define the function argumentFunction. This function should take two arguments a and b which will then be added and printed by the syntax print(a+b). The driver code only calls the function.

SOLUTION
def argumentFunction(a,b):
    print(a+b)
